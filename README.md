# 📘 Project Documentation: Decentralized IP Marketplace on ICP

## 🎯 Project Overview

A decentralized marketplace built on the Internet Computer (ICP) where users can register, buy, sell, license, and transfer ownership of intellectual property (IP) such as patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets. This system uses smart contracts (Rust-based canisters) and the DIP721 NFT standard to tokenize and track ownership of IP assets.

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

### 1. **Frontend (React + Tailwind + Next.js)**

* User-facing UI for browsing, listing, licensing, and transferring IP NFTs
* Internet Identity login integration
* Plug Wallet integration for crypto transactions
* IP asset upload and registration forms

### 2. **Backend (Rust Canisters on ICP)**

* **IP Registry Canister**: Registers IP, mints DIP721 NFTs, stores metadata
* **License Engine Canister**: Issues licenses, tracks royalty terms, validates license actions
* **Payment Processor Canister**: Handles payments, escrow, royalty distribution

### 3. **Storage Layer**

* **Stable memory** for structured data (NFTs, users, licenses)
* **IPFS/ICP Asset Canisters** for storing legal documents and files

### 4. **Authentication**

* Internet Identity for secure, passwordless login and user identification

### 5. **Token Standard**

* DIP721 NFT for representing IP ownership
* Each token stores IP metadata and document hash

## 🔧 Backend Modules and Canisters

### 🔹 1. IP Registry Canister (Rust)

**Responsibilities:**

* Mint DIP721 NFTs
* Store and manage IP asset metadata
* Track IP ownership
* Allow asset transfer

**Important Functions:**

* `register_ip_asset(...)`
* `mint_nft_to(owner: Principal, metadata: IpAsset)`
* `transfer_ip_asset(token_id: u64, new_owner: Principal)`
* `get_ip_metadata(token_id: u64)`

**IP Metadata Schema:**

```rust
pub struct IpAsset {
    id: u64,
    owner: Principal,
    title: String,
    ip_type: IpType,
    jurisdiction: String,
    license_type: LicenseType,
    description: String,
    hash_of_docs: String,
    registered_at: u64,
    licenses: Vec<LicenseInfo>,
}
```

### 🔹 2. License Engine Canister (Rust)

**Responsibilities:**

* Smart contract–based IP licensing
* Create exclusive/non-exclusive licenses
* Time-bound or perpetual use rights

**Important Functions:**

* `create_license(token_id, licensee, terms)`
* `validate_license_usage(token_id, licensee)`
* `get_license_history(token_id)`

**LicenseInfo Struct:**

```rust
pub struct LicenseInfo {
    licensee: Principal,
    start_date: u64,
    end_date: Option<u64>,
    royalty_terms: String,
    terms_url: String,
}
```

---

### 🔹 3. Payment Processor Canister

**Responsibilities:**

* Handle ICP token transfers between buyer/seller
* Escrow management
* Royalty split and distribution

**Important Functions:**

* `initiate_payment(token_id, buyer)`
* `release_funds(token_id)`
* `get_escrow_balance(principal)`

## 🖼 Frontend Modules

### Pages:

* `/` - Home with featured IP assets
* `/register` - IP registration form
* `/explore` - Browse/search IP assets
* `/asset/:id` - IP details, licensing options
* `/profile/:user` - User’s owned and licensed IPs

### Components:

* `AssetCard` - Display basic asset info
* `LicenseForm` - Create/select licensing options
* `UploadSection` - File upload for document hash
* `IdentityLogin` - Internet Identity integration
* `PlugWalletButton` - Connect and sign payments

### State Management:

* Use React Context or Zustand to manage user data and IP assets locally

## 🧠 Smart Licensing Logic (Inspired by Story Protocol)

* Modular license terms (CC-like)
* Support for remixable/derivative IP
* On-chain license and attribution graphs
* Time-limited or usage-based licenses
* Auto-revocation on expiration
